The Seeed 24GHz mmWave Radar Sensor is a self-contained, privacy-protectively, safety mmWave module operating at 24GHz. With the enhanced Infineon Doppler radar and the standard algorithm, the module is an ideal solution for individual applications like elderly health care, smart home, and danger alarm.

The unit supports secondary developments and the improvable factors like small size, digital output, inside algorithm, allow it can be applied in a variety of scenarios applications by universal UART communication interface through a development board like Wio Terminal or the XIAO series.
