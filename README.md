!!!Tip
    If you are using an older version of the OP and firmware, please [upgrade to the latest version](#firmware-version-updates) as soon as possible to ensure you can enjoy the software protocol and Wiki content.

The following five sections explain the role of each part of the software.

<div align=center><img width = 800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_img/1.png"/></div>

1. Connection Setup

    Select the port to which the sensor is connected to the computer. It is usually necessary to refresh the port by clicking the **Refresh Serial Port button** before selecting it. Once the serial port is selected correctly, the data is automatically updated in circle 4 (if any data is available).

2. Function Setting

    - **Debugging**: When this function is turned on, real-time raw data can be output in the software. This is the window in circle 3 in the figure.
    - **Save Raw Data**: When you click on it, you can choose to keep the original data to your local computer. Note, however, that this option does not save new data after the button is clicked, only the most recent historical data.
    - **Save Sleep Data**: When you click on it, you can choose the path to save the raw data information related to sleep, while other data will not be saved. Note, however, that this option does not save new data after the button is clicked, only the most recent historical data.

3. Serial Monitor

    This window appears when the **Debugging** option in circle 2 is checked, at which point the area displays real-time sensor data frames. At the bottom you can send command frames to the sensor. The commands that can be sent or queried can be found in the user manual of the sensor.

4. Graphic Display

    This shows the line graph in real time. The data content displayed is respiratory rate, heart rate, and physical parameters, respectively. The horizontal coordinate is the time and the vertical coordinate is the corresponding data.

5. Status & Orientation

    This area allows you to observe the state of human presence and the orientation of the human body. The human body orientation data is for reference only.

#### Function

Before we get started developing a sketch, let's look at the available functions of the library.

- `void recvRadarBytes()` —— This function collects the data frames reported by the Sensor via the UART according to the frame headers and frame tails in the Sensor data protocol. Used in conjunction with the `showData()` function, the collected data information can be printed out via the serial port.

  - **Input parameters:** None

  - **Return value:** None

- `void showData()` —— This function serves to print out the complete data frame reported by the Sensor at once via the serial port and needs to be used in conjunction with the `recvRadarBytes()` function.

  - **Input parameters:** None

  - **Return value:** None

- `void HumanExis_Func()` —— This function is responsible for parsing the data frames of the Sensor and outputting the relevant data on the state of the human presence.

  - **Input parameters:** None

  - **Return value:**

    - `unsigned int sensor_report` —— The value returned indicates which status class the parsed data frame belongs to. The specific categories can be found in the **Default Variables** section. Human movement information is reported only when changes occur.

    - `int bodysign_val` —— The value returned represents the value of the Human Movement Parameter. This value is reported once per second.

    - `float distance` —— The sensor determines the current distance to the human body, the value is in meters. This value is reported once every 2 seconds.

    - `float Dir_x, Dir_y, Dir_z` —— Indicates the body position information detected by the sensor. The human position information has positive and negative units in meters. This value is reported once every 2 seconds.

    - `unsigned int heart_point_1, heart_point_2, heart_point_3, heart_point_4, heart_point_5` —— Heart rate waveform data. 5 bytes represent 5 values in 1s in real time, the waveform is sine wave data, the central axis is 128 which means when the heart rate intensity is 0, it will be displayed as 128. This value is reported once per second.

    - `unsigned int breath_rate` —— Breathing values. Reported every 3 seconds. Value range 0~20.

    - `unsigned int breath_point_1, breath_point_2, breath_point_3, breath_point_4, breath_point_5` —— Breath rate waveform data. 5 bytes represent 5 values in 1s in real time, the waveform is sine wave data, the central axis is 128 which means when the heart rate intensity is 0, it will be displayed as 128. This value is reported once per second.

- `void SleepInf_Decode()` —— This function is responsible for parsing the sleep data information reported by the sensors. It is only valid when the monitored people has entered the bed and has been asleep for more than five minutes. Please make sure that Sleep state transfer mode is enabled when using this function.

  - **Input parameters:** None

  - **Return value:** 

    - `unsigned int sensor_report` —— The value returned indicates which status class the parsed data frame belongs to. The specific categories can be found in the **Default Variables** section.

    - `unsigned int awake_time` —— This value indicates the waking time of the monitored person if the person has gone to bed. This value will be reported every ten minutes along with other sleep status data.

    - `unsigned int light_time` —— This value indicates the light sleep time of the monitored character in case the character is already in bed. This value will be reported every ten minutes along with other sleep status data.

Since you have downloaded the zip Library, open your Arduino IDE, click on **Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library**. Choose the zip file you just downloaded，and if the library install correct, you will see **Library added to your libraries** in the notice window. Which means the library is installed successfully.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Get_Started_With_Arduino/img/Add_Zip.png"/></div>


## Arduino Example

Now that we have our library installed and we understand the basic functions, let's run some examples for our XIAO BLE to see how it behaves.

### Materials Required

Before completing the following examples, you will need to prepare the following materials.

**Step 2.** In the menu bar in the upper left corner of the Arduino IDE, select **tool**, choose the type of development board you are using, and select the corresponding serial port.

!!!Tip
    If you are using **MacOS**, the serial port name of the device will often start with **/dev/cu.usbmodem xxx**, ending with the name of the device. If you are using **Windows**, the device's serial port name will often begin with **COM**, again ending with the device's name.

<div align=center><img width = 700 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/3.png"/></div>

In this example, we will demonstrate how the radar works with our popular product XIAO BLE.

### Demo1 Raw data export

This example will guide you through the process of printing out the raw data reported by the Sensor via the serial port.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR60BHA1_print_rawdata**.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzbreathheart.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//BreathHeart_60GHz radar = BreathHeart_60GHz(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
BreathHeart_60GHz radar = BreathHeart_60GHz(&Serial1);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.recvRadarBytes();           //Receive radar data and start processing
  radar.showData();                 //Serial port prints a set of received data frames
  delay(200);                       //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

In this program, we are using the XIAO nRF52840's hardware **Serial1** port to connect to the Sensor and use the hardware **Serial** port Serial to output data, so we need to initialise this serial port separately in the initialisation function `Setup()`.

In the main `loop()` function we use the function `recvRadarBytes()` to receive data frames from the Sensor and then use the `showData()` function to print out the received data frames via the serial port.

In this program, it is important to note that there is an interval between the reception and output of every two data frames to avoid a jam on the main board. This time should be no less than **150ms**. 

This means that there is no way for the main board to receive all the data frames reported by the Sensor, but as the number of frames reported by the Sensor is very large and frequent, this does not affect the accuracy of using the Sensor to determine the environment.

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_img/2.png"/></div>

### Demo2: Use of human presence detection function

In this example, we will explain how to use the function of human presence detection and print out all the values of this function in the function through the serial monitor.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR60BHA1_human_existence_inf_output**.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzbreathheart.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//BreathHeart_60GHz radar = BreathHeart_60GHz(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
BreathHeart_60GHz radar = BreathHeart_60GHz(&Serial1);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.HumanExis_Func();           //Human existence information output
  if(radar.sensor_report != 0x00){
    switch(radar.sensor_report){
      case NOONE:
        Serial.println("Nobody here.");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case SOMEONE:
        Serial.println("Someone is here.");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case NONEPSE:
        Serial.println("No human activity messages.");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case STATION:
        Serial.println("Someone stop");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case MOVE:
        Serial.println("Someone moving");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case BODYVAL:
        Serial.print("The parameters of human body signs are: ");
        Serial.println(radar.bodysign_val, DEC);
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case DISVAL:
        Serial.print("The sensor judges the distance to the human body to be: ");
        Serial.print(radar.distance, DEC);
        Serial.println(" m");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case DIREVAL:
        Serial.print("The sensor judges the orientation data with the human body as -- x: ");
        Serial.print(radar.Dir_x);
        Serial.print(" m, y: ");
        Serial.print(radar.Dir_y);
        Serial.print(" m, z: ");
        Serial.print(radar.Dir_z);
        Serial.println(" m");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
    }
  }
  delay(200);                       //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

In this example, the function to detect the presence of a human body is implemented by the `HumanExis_Func()` function. The basic logic of the program implementation is that the `HumanExis_Func()` function assigns the status information reported by the sensor to the `sensor_report` variable. Based on the value of `sensor_report`, we then print out all the values in that state through the serial port.

Note that the `sensor_report` corresponds to the data output from the serial port under indentation. For example, the `bodysign_val` variable representing the sign parameter is only valid when `sensor_report` is `BODYVAL`, and is not present in other `sensor_reports` reported by the sensor.

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_img/3.png"/></div>


### Demo3: The use of respiratory and heartbeat functions in the resting people

In this example, we will use the `Breath_Heart()` function to detect the breathing and heart rate of a stationary human body.

!!!Tip
    Our emphasis is on detecting breathing and heart rate in a stationary human body. Please do not use the product while the human body is in motion, as we have limited the heart rate and breathing of the sensor. The maximum heart rate will **not exceed 100** and the maximum respiratory rate will **not exceed 25**.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR60BHA1_Breath_heartbeat_inf_output**.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzbreathheart.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//BreathHeart_60GHz radar = BreathHeart_60GHz(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
BreathHeart_60GHz radar = BreathHeart_60GHz(&Serial1);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");

  // radar.ModeSelect_fuc(1);  //1: indicates real-time transmission mode, 2: indicates sleep state mode.
  //After setting the mode, if you do not see data returned, you may need to re-power the sensor.
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.Breath_Heart();           //Breath and heartbeat information output
  if(radar.sensor_report != 0x00){
    switch(radar.sensor_report){
      case HEARTRATEVAL:
        Serial.print("Sensor monitored the current heart rate value is: ");
        Serial.println(radar.heart_rate, DEC);
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case HEARTRATEWAVE:  //Valid only when real-time data transfer mode is on
        Serial.print("The heart rate waveform(Sine wave) -- point 1: ");
        Serial.print(radar.heart_point_1);
        Serial.print(", point 2 : ");
        Serial.print(radar.heart_point_2);
        Serial.print(", point 3 : ");
        Serial.print(radar.heart_point_3);
        Serial.print(", point 4 : ");
        Serial.print(radar.heart_point_4);
        Serial.print(", point 5 : ");
        Serial.println(radar.heart_point_5);
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case BREATHNOR:
        Serial.println("Sensor detects current breath rate is normal.");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case BREATHRAPID:
        Serial.println("Sensor detects current breath rate is too fast.");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case BREATHSLOW:
        Serial.println("Sensor detects current breath rate is too slow.");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case BREATHNONE:
        Serial.println("There is no breathing information yet, please wait...");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case BREATHVAL:
        Serial.print("Sensor monitored the current breath rate value is: ");
        Serial.println(radar.breath_rate, DEC);
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case BREATHWAVE:  //Valid only when real-time data transfer mode is on
        Serial.print("The breath rate waveform(Sine wave) -- point 1: ");
        Serial.print(radar.breath_point_1);
        Serial.print(", point 2 : ");
        Serial.print(radar.breath_point_2);
        Serial.print(", point 3 : ");
        Serial.print(radar.breath_point_3);
        Serial.print(", point 4 : ");
        Serial.print(radar.breath_point_4);
        Serial.print(", point 5 : ");
        Serial.println(radar.breath_point_5);
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
    }
  }
  delay(200);                       //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_img/4.png"/></div>

!!!Attention
    If you want to see waveform data, switch the sensor to real-time data transmission mode. After switching modes, the sensor may need to be re-powered to take effect.

### Demo4: Use of the sleep function

In this example, we will guide you how to get the information about sleep by using the `SleepInf_Decode()` function. Please make sure that you or the testing people is ready to go to bed before using this example.

!!!Note
    By default, the sensor is in sleep state transmission mode. In this mode, the sleep monitoring function is on. If you switch to real-time data transmission mode, then sleep data may not be available. If you want to change the transfer mode, you can use the `ModeSelect_fuc()` function to do so. Examples of use can also be found in the **MR60BHA1_Transfer_mode_selection** in the examples folder. After switching modes, the sensor may need to be re-powered to take effect.
    The data related to sleep needs to be reported when a person is in bed, and the current firmware defaults to judging that someone is in bed after a person state lasts 5 minutes.


The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR60BHA1_Sleep_inf_output**.

```c++

  Serial.println("Readly");
}

{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.SleepInf_Decode();           //Sleep-related information output. Data output begins when the monitoring figure is in bed for five minutes.

  delay(200);                       //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

### Demo5: Send data to Sensor

Based on the details provided in the user manual, the user can send command frames to the sensor to query or set certain states or modes of the sensor according to the actual needs.

The .ino file named **MR60BHA1_Send_frame** in the examples folder of the sensor library shows us how to send a program that queries the device ID to the sensor.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzbreathheart.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//BreathHeart_60GHz radar = BreathHeart_60GHz(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
BreathHeart_60GHz radar = BreathHeart_60GHz(&Serial1);

const unsigned char DevID_buff[10] = {0x53, 0x59, 0x02, 0xA1, 0x00, 0x01, 0x0F, 0x5F, 0x54, 0x43};

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.send_func(DevID_buff, 10, false);
  delay(50);                       //Do not set the delay time too long, as this may affect the reception of the data frames returned by the radar.
}
```

In the program of this example, you can see that an array `DevID_buff[10]` is defined, which stores the hexadecimal number of your query device ID, one location per byte.

And the sending is done by `send_func()`. The parameters passed in are the array of frames to be sent, the length of the array, and whether to send in a loop.

If you need to send your own command frames, then you need to define the correct array according to the frame format provided in the user manual.

!!!Tip
    **Regarding the calculation of the check digit "sum".**
    All data frames have a checksum bit to ensure that the data is sent or received accurately. The checksum bit is usually in the penultimate bit of the data frame. It is calculated by adding up all the bits preceding the check bit and taking the lower two bits in hexadecimal.
    Let's take the example of a data frame that queries the device ID.
    <div align=center><img width = 800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/6.png"/></div>
    It can be seen that the checksum bit is in the penultimate bit of the entire data frame. Then we start by adding all the previous hexadecimal numbers.

    `0x53 + 0x59 + 0x02 + 0xA2 + 0x00 + 0x01 + 0x0F = 0x015F`

    Then we need to take the lower two digits of it, which would be **5F**, so the checksum of this data frame is **5F**. If we want to look up the ID of the Sensor, then you can define the following array.

    `const unsigned char DevID_buff[10] = {0x53, 0x59, 0x02, 0xA1, 0x00, 0x01, 0x0F, 0x5F, 0x54, 0x43};`

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_img/5.png"/></div>

At this point please check the data frames returned and if they match the data frames returned as described in the user manual.

Normally, our commands do not need to be repeated to the Sensor, but as the Sensor replies with messages so fast that we cannot be sure that we will receive the exact data message returned by the Sensor. There are two solutions to this problem.
- Re-upload the above procedure several times.
- Set the third parameter of the `send_func()` function (cyclic sending) to `true`. Please note, however, that repeatedly sending data frames of the setting type **may cause the Sensor to jam**, so please use this function with caution. If the Sensor is stuck, disconnect the 5V supply pin from the Sensor and wait a few moments for the function to resume.

### Demo6: Reset Sensor

There may be times when you have problems with your Sensor detecting anomalies or when you want to clear all settings on your Sensor, then you can reset your Sensor according to this example.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR60BHA1_Reset_sensor**.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzbreathheart.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//BreathHeart_60GHz radar = BreathHeart_60GHz(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
BreathHeart_60GHz radar = BreathHeart_60GHz(&Serial1);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");

  radar.reset_func();
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
}
```

Resetting the Sensor is very simple, you just need to call `reset_func()`. The reset only needs to be **executed once**, so we use it in the `Setup()` function.

### Demo7: Using Arduino/Seeeduino

Our library is Arduino compatible and you can also choose the Arduino you have on hand to develop your Sensor project.

The MR60BHA1 Sensor communicates using the UART serial port, you just need to connect the Sensor to your Arduino as wired below.

<table align="center">
	<tr>
	    <td align="center">MR60BHA1 Sensor</td>
	    <td align="center"></td>
        <td align="center">MCU</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td align="center">5V</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">5V</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td align="center">GND</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">GND</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
	    <td align="center">RX</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">soft serial port TX</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
	    <td align="center">TX</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">soft serial port RX</td>
	</tr>
</table>

All the functions are applied in the same way as in Demo1 to Demo6 above, so we will not repeat them in this example. In this example, we will give you an overview of how to use the Arduino's soft serial port to get data information from the Sensor.

!!!Tip
    For notes on the Arduino soft serial port, please refer to the [official Arduino documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/software-serial).

To avoid data confusion caused by using Serial for both output and data transmission, on the Arduino side we usually use a soft serial port.

The import of the soft serial port library and the definition of the RX and TX pins need to be done earlier in the program. The following program defines the **A2** and **A3** pins as the **RX** and **TX** pins of the soft serial port.

```c++
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
//Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
#define RX_Pin A2
#define TX_Pin A3

SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

//we'll be using software serial
HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&mySerial);
```

Also, don't forget to set the baud rate for the soft serial port in the `Setup()` function.

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);

  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");
}
```

Using **Demo1** as an example, if you want to use the Arduino to print the reported data frames from the Sensor, then the complete program is as follows.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzbreathheart.h>

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
#define RX_Pin A2
#define TX_Pin A3

SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
BreathHeart_60GHz radar = BreathHeart_60GHz(&mySerial);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);

  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.recvRadarBytes();           //Receive radar data and start processing
  radar.showData();                 //Serial port prints a set of received data frames
  delay(200);                       //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

### Demo8: Direct connection to PC for data

You can refer to this routine if you want to use an upper computer designed for Sensor, or if you want to use the serial software to get a complete data frame.

Connect the Sensor directly to the computer's usb port via a **UART to USB** device. The wiring is shown in the table below.

<table align="center">
	<tr>
	    <td colspan="4"><div align=center><img width = 800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/uart.png"/></div></td></td>
	</tr >
	<tr >
	    <td align="center">UART to USB</td>
	    <td align="center"></td>
        <td align="center">MR60BHA1 Sensor</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td align="center">5V</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">5V</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td align="center">GND</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">GND</td>
	</tr>
  <tr>
	    <td align="center">RX</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">TX</td>
	</tr>
  <tr>
	    <td align="center">TX</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">RX</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Use a software like serial debugging assistant to select the serial port where the Sensor is located.

<div align=center><img width = 200 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/37.png"/></div>

!!!Attention
    MR60BHA1 Sensor needs 5V power supply, otherwise the Sensor may not work properly.

After a successful connection, you will see the Sensor sending a steady stream of messages.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/39.png"/></div>

At the same time, you can also send data frames to the Sensor via the software's send function.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/40.png"/></div>

!!!Attention
    If you choose **ASCII** as the format for sending data, each data set needs to be prefixed with **0x**. If you choose **HEX**, then each set of data does not need to be prefixed with **0x**.

## Troubleshooting

### FAQ1: Can this Sensor detect more than one person at a time in the same environment?

> A: Not available. This Sensor can only be used on a single living object. If more than one person or animal is in the monitoring range, this will have an effect on the results of the monitoring.

### FAQ2: Why can't I see anything in the serial monitor with the XIAO ESP32C3?

> XIAO ESP32C3 serial port function is not quite consistent with the general Arduino hardware, and using Serial1 directly may cause the USB serial port not to work. For related application cases, please go to the [Serial chapter of XIAO ESP32C3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Pin_Multiplexing/#serial) for details.
